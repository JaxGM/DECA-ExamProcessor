1,What is created when the U.S. Supreme Court rules that a business activity is unconstitutional?,Federal agency,Common law,State law,International law,B,"Common law. Common law is law created by court decisions rather than through written legislation.

This example does not depict the  creation of a federal agency, state law, or international law.",false,
2,A good way to determine the most relevant information in a textbook is by,scanning the glossary that is located in the back of the textbook.,taking detailed notes on each example provided in the textbook.,reading the review questions at the end of each chapter or section.,memorizing each section's titles and subtitles.,C,"Reading the review questions at the end of each chapter or section. When reading a textbook, it is helpful  to review the questions at the end of the chapter because the review questions' answers typically indicate  the most relevant information or key points covered in the chapter or section. Taking detailed notes about  each example in the text is not feasible and may not be helpful in identifying the most important  information. The glossary defines key terms; however, the glossary does not put the terms in the context  needed to understand the text as a whole. Titles and subtitles describe the topics that are to be covered  in the text but do not provide detailed information that might be relevant.",false,
3,Which of the following statements regarding company policies is true:,Company policies identify very specific employee actions.,Company policies and procedures are the same thing.,Company policies describe emergency measures.,Company policies identify general company rules.,D,"Company policies identify general company rules. Company policies are rules made in advance by  management to assist employees in decision-making. They are typically general rather than specific in  nature and relate to the company's overall vision. Company policies also describe to whom the rules  apply and why they exist. Company policies and procedures are not the same; company procedures  provide more detailed step-by-step plans of how to carry out policies and processes. Company  procedures identify very specific employee actions, such as what to do in the event of an emergency.",false,
4,Which of the following is a rule of good listening:,Be thinking about what you will say next.,Eliminate background noise.,Listen with empathy.,Stand as close as possible to the speaker.,C,"Listen with empathy.

6,What communication style is most appropriate to use when you are providing a friend with personal  advice?,Empathic,Formal,Judgmental,Businesslike,A,"Empathic. Being empathic is acting according to an intellectual identification with the thoughts, feelings,  values, attitudes, and/or actions of another person. It is often helpful to imagine yourself in your friend's  place, to try to understand how s/he feels. By doing so, you often gain insight and can better help your  friend by providing thoughtful advice. If you are too formal, judgmental, or businesslike with a friend, you  may come across as uncaring, and you may offend your friend.",false,

To be a good listener while handling telephone calls,  you need to learn to shut out distractions, put aside what you are working on, and focus on what the  speaker is saying. This is not a natural skill, but it is one that can be learned through practice. There will  still be times when, no matter how carefully you listen, you will have to ask questions.",false,
8,"When Dale is taking notes during a staff meeting, he should",avoid abbreviations and symbols.,write his notes in complete sentences.,capture every word that is said.,organize his notes in a logical manner.,D,"Organize his notes in a logical manner. Effective note-taking is essential in school as well as on the job.  Regardless of whether you are in a university lecture hall or in a staff meeting, taking notes helps you  better remember important information and record facts, figures, and other details that may not be  available elsewhere. Notes that are organized in a logical manner are much clearer, more  understandable, and easier to read than notes that follow no form at all. When taking notes, it is not  necessary to capture every word that is said. Instead, you should focus on the main points and subpoints  of the conversation. It is also not necessary to write notes in complete sentences. To save time and  space, you should use abbreviations and symbols whenever appropriate.",false,
9,Which of the following is a guideline for developing effective written communication:,Be thorough.,Be repetitious.,Be wordy.,Be trite.,A,"Be thorough. Effective written communication must be thorough and contain all the information necessary  for the recipient to respond or react.

10,Which of the following is a formatting characteristic of a full-block business letter:,Double-spacing within the paragraph,No paragraph indents,Indented first paragraph,Paragraphs use right justification,B,"No paragraph indents.

Other formatting characteristics of full-block letters are the use of single-  spacing within the paragraphs and the use of double-spacing between the paragraphs.",false,

A good business letter should present a message in plain language that is clear and  easy to understand. The message should be well organized so that it follows a logical sequence.

The information is not an inquiry unless someone asks for  something.",false,
13,A person who publicly tweets negative comments about his/her company is most likely to be,prosecuted.,laughed at.,promoted.,fired.,D,"Fired. An individual's ""personal brand"" on social media can either positively or negatively influence a  company and its ability to achieve its organizational goals. If an individual publicly tweets negative  comments about his/her company, s/he is likely to be fired, not promoted. Employees serve as unofficial  brand ambassadors for their companies, so it is important that they represent their company well at all  times—even online. An individual who publicly tweets negative comments about his/her company may be  laughed at, but it is more likely that s/he would be fired. It is unlikely that an employee would be  prosecuted for publicly tweeting negative comments about his/her company, since this behavior is  protected under free speech laws.",false,
14,Penelope wants to use an interactive channel to communicate with her employees. Which channel of  communication should she choose?,A phone call,A voice mail,A letter,A report,A,"A phone call. Interactive communication goes two ways. There is a back-and-forth conversation involved,  like on a phone call.

If Penelope wants to use an interactive channel of communication, she should  call her employees. She might also consider talking to them in person.",false,
15,"When participating in staff meetings, business employees should be prepared to",remain silent.,join in the discussion.,comment on every detail.,argue.,B,"Join in the discussion. For staff meetings to be effective, all employees should participate in the  discussion. The purpose of staff meetings usually is to discuss issues that are of importance to the  business, or to solve problems. Therefore, employees should join in the discussion rather than remain  silent because their ideas and opinions are valuable. Employees should not comment on every detail.  Employees should adequately explain their ideas, but it is not effective to start an argument with those  who disagree.",false,
16,A disadvantage of problem-solving in groups is that it,decreases risk-taking.,decreases conformity.,takes more time.,hinders communication.,C,"Takes more time. Group problem-solving takes more time than individual problem-solving because of  conflicting schedules, differing opinions, and more discussion.

17,"As employees go about their daily activities, their actions should be driven by whether the actions will",result in additional sales.,result in customer satisfaction.,bring them personal fulfillment.,be witnessed by customers.,B,"Result in customer satisfaction. Making customers feel important is a goal of demonstrating a customer  service mindset. Customers should feel welcome and that their satisfaction is important to everyone  concerned.

By understanding and being aware of cultural differences, businesspeople  can adapt their communication styles to make a positive impression on their clients, earn their clients'  trust, and persuade their clients to buy. Businesspeople who adapt their communication styles are aware  of actions that a particular client might view as hospitable, as well as behaviors that the client might find  offensive. Offensive behaviors can hinder the ability to build long-term relationships with international  clients.",false,
19,What is a factor that affects a business's selection of policies to guide its operations?,Nature of the business,Personal preferences of management,Communication skills of employees,Space available to display policies,A,"Nature of the business. A business's policies must be appropriate for the type of business. For example,  a policy that might be appropriate for an investment business might be inappropriate for a hardware  store. Not all business policies are written, and it would not be necessary to display them. The personal  preferences of management should not be a consideration. Employees who lack good communication  skills can receive training that will improve their skills in communicating policies to customers.",false,

24,"Whether prices go up or down, the relationship between relative prices does not change if the  __________ remains the same.",ratio,value,market,resource,A,"Ratio.

A market (free enterprise) economy is an economic system in which individuals and  groups, rather than the government, own or control the means of production. A characteristic of a market  economy is that individuals and businesses can use their skills and other resources to compete with  other individuals and businesses for scarce consumer dollars. A communist command economy is a  command economic system in which the government controls the economic system and does not allow  private ownership of resources and production. Imperialism occurs when one territory or country takes  control, often by force, of the political and economic system of another territory or country.

Affirmations are positive statements about present or desired  strengths. These are things that you want to accept, incorporate, or develop. Carrying around 3x5 index  cards for a week would be unproductive if Mary does not write positive affirmations relating to her  development of motivation on the job. To daydream about being a superstar in life does not advance  Mary's self-esteem. The difference between self-esteem and affirmations is that self-esteem is the way  people feel about themselves, and an affirmation is a positive statement, or statements, that assist in the  development or improvement of a person's self-esteem.",false,

This is an example of how",perfectionism allows people to better manage commitments.,organization leads to overcommitment.,commitment leads to professional success.,technology hampers one's ability to manage commitments.,D,"Technology hampers one's ability to manage commitments. Technology makes it difficult to manage  commitments because it is easier to do more—and to do more at once. Jon finds it difficult to focus on  getting one task done because of the constant presence of his email, prompting him to take on other  commitments before he finishes the first. This is not an example of how organization leads to  overcommitment, how commitment leads to professional success, or how perfectionism allows people to  better manage commitments.",false,
38,"Jennifer is a person who exhibits self-control in difficult situations. She always remains calm, is patient,  empathetic, and a good listener.

Some businesses consider email to be corporate property and routinely monitor  the messages that employees send and receive. If a business monitors email, it should inform its  employees in order to respect their privacy. Employees have the right to know if someone in the business  will read their email so that they can decide the type of information they will include. They might not want  to send or receive personal messages if they know a manager might read their mail. A business that  informs employees that their email will be monitored is communicating a policy. Businesses do not inform  employees that their email will be monitored to reduce their liability or to control operating costs.",false,

Many people ignore ethics because they  don't realize how important ethics are—and how serious the consequences of unethical behavior can be.  Sasha does not see the importance of behaving ethically in regard to her homework. To best help her,  you should make sure she understands why it is important to be ethical. She will then be more likely to do  so. You should not necessarily report her behavior to your teacher because Sasha has not done anything  wrong, yet. While it is a good idea to follow the rules, Sasha's belief that ethics aren't valuable likely won't  change just from noticing what you do. Finally, telling Sasha that you do not approve of her decision to  cheat wouldn't be as effective as explaining why ethical behavior is valuable.",false,

Calling in sick only if you are truly sick is an example of carrying your own  weight in the process of building positive working relationships. When you carry your own weight, you are  not making your coworkers pick up unnecessary slack.

When you're dealing with an ethical situation, you're deciding whether  something is right or wrong. Often in an ethical situation, if you pick the wrong choice, someone (or  something) could be harmed. This doesn't necessarily mean that the issue must be life or death, but that  the wrong action could cause someone or something to be hurt.
